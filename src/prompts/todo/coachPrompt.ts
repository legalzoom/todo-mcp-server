// Concept: Prompts (no arguments) — a prompt that takes no input and produces
// a canned instruction referencing specific tools and resources by name.
// https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/prompts
//
// Also demonstrates:
//   • Multi-turn prompts — messages with both "user" and "assistant" roles seed
//     a conversation with pre-filled context. The LLM continues from where the
//     conversation leaves off.
